# FreeLearn

## Â¿What is FreeLearn?

The purpose of this project is to create an education platform where teachers can create courses and we put it inside videogames, mapping the different events of the game, such as opening chests or grabbing a weapon, with the diferent SCOs (Sharable objects contents) of the course created in SCORM format.

Freelearn is a modular project (made by engines) written is Ruby On Rails, that is currently under development.

This project contains a fork of [VISH Editor](https://github.com/ging/vish_editor) and [Scorm into Games](https://github.com/ebarra/scorm_into_games) which are being converted into engines and rewritten to acomplish this task.
