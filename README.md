# FreeLearn

## Â¿What is FreeLearn?

The purpose of this project is to create an education platform where teachers make courses and place them inside videogames, mapping the different events of the game, such as opening chests or grabbing a weapon, with the different activities of the course. The expectations are to get student attention easier and soften the learning curve by making the learning proccess an actual game.

Freelearn is a modular project (made by engines) written is Ruby On Rails, that is currently under development.

This project contains a fork of [VISH Editor](https://github.com/ging/vish_editor) and [Scorm into Games](https://github.com/ebarra/scorm_into_games) which are being converted into engines and rewritten to acomplish this task.
